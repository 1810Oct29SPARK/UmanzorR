                <p>As you can see by the list, there is a pattern from NFL players that have been diagnosed with CTE after death.</p> 
                <p>It's not uncommon for CTE patients to pass away earlier than the average human. Causes of death vary between</p>
                <p>people. Late stage CTE usually comes with early-onset alzheimers, which in and of itself leads to other life</p>
                <p>life threatening symptoms. Suicide is a big concern among people of CTE with many football players, both in</p>
                <p>the NFL level and college level. Details of the some of these players can be found below.</p>
